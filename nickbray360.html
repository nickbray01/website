                    <p>The 360 photo above is part of a tour that I did for Brookside Club of Saratoga. When I was paying for Kuula Premium, there were markers on the page that you could click to move around the club. Now you can only see one photo at a time, but it gives you a sense of the interactivity these photos add to an online real estate listing. The iFrame is one line of HTML that can be added to any website.</p>

                    <div class="subheading mb-3">To make virtual reality tours a more accessible technology for real estate agents</div>
                    <div>The idea for NickBray360 first came to me when I was scrolling through YouTube watching filmmaking tutorials. I kept getting the same advertisement for a new GoPro camera that was coming out - the GoPro Fusion. I didn’t give the ad much thought, I figured since I was already looking for filmmaking tutorials I was bound to get advertisements for cameras. But then I accidentally clicked the ad. And the video moved. I had changed the camera angle, and suddenly I was looking at the person’s point of view instead of the person. This was the first video I had seen in this new format, and I loved it. My video’s perspective was at the center of a videosphere, and I could turn in any direction I wanted, seeing everything visible to this point in space. I’ve linked the video below.</div>

                    <br>
                    <div>After spending some time watching this video, I wanted to be a part of this emerging technology. I started researching the VR market. The main use case I was seeing again and again was real estate tours. All the hobbyists who were getting virtual reality cameras were funding their hobby by making virtual walkthroughs for local businesses. The appeal was obvious to me - the ability to look in any direction makes it feel almost as if you're standing in the spot where to picture was taken. So I went to Zillow to see if anybody in my area was listing houses with a virtual reality walkthrough, and I noticed an unsettling trend. Virtual Reality technology was available and being used on the platform. <strong>But I couldn’t find a single real estate listing under 4 million dollars where that VR tour was part of the listing.</strong> Something was keeping real estate agents with a lower budget from accessing this new technology that I knew would revolutionize online house showings. So I decided to do something about it.
