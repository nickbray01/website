                    <p>The 360 photo above is part of a tour that I did for Brookside Club of Saratoga. The iFrame is one line of HTML that can be added to any website. When I was paying for Kuula premium, multiple 360 photos were linked together inside the same iFrame so that you could "walk" through the property.</p>

                    <div class="subheading mb-3">To make virtual reality tours a more accessible technology for real estate agents</div>
                    <div>The idea for NickBray360 first came to me when I was scrolling through YouTube watching filmmaking tutorials. I kept getting the same advertisement for a new GoPro camera that was coming out - the GoPro Fusion. I didn’t give the ad much thought, I figured since I was already looking for filmmaking tutorials I was bound to get advertisements for cameras. But then I accidentally clicked the ad. And the video moved. I had changed the camera angle, and suddenly I was looking at the person’s point of view instead of the person. This was the first video I had seen harnessing VR technology, and I knew instantly that it would change the way we interact with media. I’ve linked the video below.</div>

                    <iframe width="560" height="315" style="max-width: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PygsKZXpYrI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <br>
                    <div>After spending some time watching this video, I wanted to be a part of this emerging technology. I started researching the VR market. The main use case I was seeing again and again was real estate tours. All the hobbyists who were getting virtual reality cameras were funding their hobby by making virtual walkthroughs for local businesses. The appeal was obvious to me - the ability to look in any direction makes it feel almost as if you're standing in the spot where to picture was taken. So I went to Zillow to see if anybody in my area was listing houses with a virtual reality walkthrough, and I noticed an unsettling trend. Virtual Reality technology was available and being used on the platform. <strong>But I couldn’t find a single real estate listing under 4 million dollars where a VR tour was part of the listing.</strong> Something was keeping real estate agents with a lower budget from accessing this new technology that I knew would revolutionize online house showings. So I decided to do something about it.

                        . I loved how easy they were to use, but zooming into the photo I didn't feel like the image was 'real estate listing' quality.
